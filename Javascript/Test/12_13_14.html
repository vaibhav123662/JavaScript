Que 12-
synchronous communication:- 
        Synchronous communication happens in real time,
        where at least two individuals are exchanging information, 
        at the same time with each other. That’s not to say that you
        need to be communicating in person for this to be deemed synchronous communication. 
        This type of communication can be virtual as well, either scheduled or a little more impromptu. 

Asynchronous communication:-
        Asynchronous communication is communication that has a lag between when a message is sent
        and when the person receiving it interprets it.This type of communication isn’t
        generally conducted in person, nor is it planned for or scheduled. 

Que 13:- What is promise
The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.






Que 14:Asynk and Await

asynk:-In the above program, the async keyword is used before the function to represent that the function is asynchronous.
ex: 
// async function example
async function f() {
    console.log('Async function.');
    return Promise.resolve(1);
}
f();





Await:-The await keyword is used inside the async function to wait for the asynchronous operation.

ex:
// a promise
let promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(function () {
    resolve('Promise resolved')}, 4000); 
});
// async function
async function asyncFunc() {

    // wait until the promise resolves 
    let result = await promise; 

    console.log(result);
    console.log('hello');
}
// calling the async function
asyncFunc();
