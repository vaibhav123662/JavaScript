ans-
call :- is a function that you use to change the value of this

 apply:- The Apply function is very similar to the Call function.
  The only difference between call and apply is the difference in how arguments are passed.

  syntax:-func.apply(thisObj, [args1, args2, ...]);

  bind:- The bind function creates a copy of a function with a new value to the this present inside the calling function.
